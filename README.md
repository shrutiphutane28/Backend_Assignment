# Backend_Assignment

This repository contains the necessary files to perform a comprehensive analysis on the reports data, including cleaning, processing, and visualizing key insights. The project is organized into four main files:

## Files in this Repository

1. **`DataEngineer.ipynb`**:
    - This Jupyter notebook contains all the necessary steps for cleaning and preprocessing the raw dataset.
    - It includes data loading, cleaning, transformations, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
    - All steps to prepare the data for analysis and visualization are covered in this file.

2. **`Reports_Metric_Table_Demo.csv`**:
    - The raw dataset used for this analysis.
    - This file contains unprocessed reports data with raw values, which needs cleaning and preprocessing.
    - You can find this data in its raw form before any transformations.

3. **`cleaned_reports_data.csv`**:
    - The cleaned version of the dataset after performing all necessary preprocessing steps.
    - This dataset is ready for analysis and includes columns such as report types, domains, user activity, workspace usage, etc.
    - It is used for generating insights and visualizations.

4. **`Streamlit_Insights_Application.py`**:
    - A Python application that leverages Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing insights from the cleaned dataset.
    - The app allows users to explore various aspects of the data such as report types, user activity, workspace usage, and more.
